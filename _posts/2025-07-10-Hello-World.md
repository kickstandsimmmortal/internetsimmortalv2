Didn't think I'd have to learn markdown to get this site working, but here we are. 

This is just a place for me to dump anything I've learned. Rooms I've cleared in TryHackMe or HackTheBox. Maybe certain commands or code I've learned and don't want to forget. Maybe someone even stumbles onto this site and can find some useful information here they'll be able to use.

* Anything you read from this point on is just me testing stuff in markdown because this is new to me

```python
print(hello, world)
```

Turns out Jekyll will ignore my posts completely if I don't title them correctly

Follow this format or you will be ignored:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md
```
